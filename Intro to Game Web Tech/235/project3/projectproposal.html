    <h1>Missile Command Asteroids</h1>
    <div id="concept">
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>So let's think about the classic arcade game Asteroids, but then instead of the ship shooting the asteroids,
            there's a turret at the bottom of the screen that you shoot with. Essentially, this is a mix-up between
            Asteroids and Missile Command, both of which are old arcade games</p>
    </div>
    <div id="genre">
        <h2>Genre</h2>
        <p>The genre of this game is the same genre as the original Asteroids, a shoot-em-up arcade game.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="platform">
        <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>This game is going to be only on desktop</p>
    </div>
    <div id="story">
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The story is simple, you're trying to keep the spaceship from being blown up while also not shooting it in
            the process</p>
    </div>
    <div id="aesthetics">
        <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>I'd like this game to have the same aesthetics as the original games Asteroids and Missile Command, so an old
            arcade-y look</p>
    </div>
    <div id="gameplay">
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
        <p>This game will focus on moving a ship around an area, avoiding asteroids, and shooting a turret at those
            asteroids, avoiding the ship</p>
        <h3>Control</h3>
        <p>To control the ship you'll use WASD and to control the turret you'll move the mouse and click to shoot</p>
        <h3>Player Learning</h3>
        <p>The player will start off with an instruction screen of how to play, then the first level will have only 1 or
            2 asteroids. Then, after destroying all of the asteroids, the next level will start with more, and so on and
            so forth</p>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>I'm Karl Meidenbauer, a second year Game Design student at RIT. I'd like to consider myself a good coder as
            well as a great level designer. I really enjoy making platformers but I figured I should try something new
            here.</p>
