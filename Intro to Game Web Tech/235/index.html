        Hi! My name is Karl Meidenbauer. I'm a second-year Game Design and Development student at the Rochester
        Institute of Technology. My interests are playing volleyball, playing video games, and making some games of my
        own. My long term goal is to eventually have my own indie studio where I can make whatever game I want but I
        know that is a ways down the road. I'm hoping to get a position with a big studio(like Nintendo, Microsoft, or
        Sony) after I graduate to get experience and connections in the industry, then hopefully branch off and do my
        own thing.
