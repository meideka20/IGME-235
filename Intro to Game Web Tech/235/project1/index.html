        <h2>Aspiring Game Developer Seeking Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Karl Meidenbauer and I'm a second-year Game Design and Development Major at the Rochester
            Institute of Technology. I enjoy figuring out the puzzle that is coding a new mechanic into a game. If I'm
            not at my computer coding, I'm probably either playing video games or playing volleyball.

                This is Life Finds a Way, a challenging 2D platformer inspired by Celeste made in Monogame with C#. I
                was the lead level designer and also designed all of the player movement.
