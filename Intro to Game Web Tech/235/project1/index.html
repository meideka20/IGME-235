            <h2>Aspiring Game Developer Seeking Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Karl Meidenbauer and I'm a second-year Game Design and Development Major at the Rochester
                Institute of Technology. I enjoy figuring out the puzzle that is coding a new mechanic into a game. I've
                made projects in Monogame with C#, and I'm currently learning Unity and Unreal. If I'm
                not at my computer coding, I'm probably either playing video games or playing volleyball.
            </p>

                This is Life Finds a Way, a challenging 2D platformer inspired by Celeste made in Monogame with C#. I
                was the lead level designer and also designed all of the player movement.
